# Social Impact of His Research Activities

**Bibliometrix** and its Shiny web app **Biblioshiny** are recognized as the most comprehensive and user-friendly software for science mapping.

In a widely cited review of bibliometric tools, Moral-Muñoz et al. (2020) stated:

> “At this moment, maybe Bibliometrix and its Shiny platform contain the more extensive set of techniques implemented, and together with the easiness of its interface, could be a great software for practitioners.”

Bibliometrix has become one of the **most used** science mapping tools, with:

-   **1 Million installations**
-   A **large international community** of researchers using and promoting it
-   **Over 150 YouTube tutorials** in multiple languages

In the past 4 years, Professor Aria has delivered **over 60 seminars** in various Italian doctoral schools (e.g., Bergamo, Brescia, Calabria, Genoa, Polytechnic of Milan, Naples, Pisa, Rome, Salento) and international ones (e.g., Bodø – Norway, Edinburgh, Granada, London, Melbourne, Paris).
