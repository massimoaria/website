------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome! I’m Massimo Aria, full professor of Statistics for Social Sciences at the Department of Economics and Statistics of the University of Naples Federico II.

My research focuses on bibliometrics, science mapping, text mining, statistical modelling, and machine learning. I am the author of over 150 scientific articles, and creator of several R packages including the widely used <a href="https://www.bibliometrix.org" target="_blank">Bibliometrix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/massimoaria/tall" target="_blank">Tall</a>.

I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://www.k-synth.com" target="_blank">K-Synth</a>, an academic spin-off dedicated to transforming data into actionable knowledge through innovative statistical and computational methods.

Over the years, I’ve been involved in numerous national and international research projects (including PRIN, PNRR, and European frameworks), and I actively support open science and reproducible research.

Beyond academia, I’m happily married to a wonderful woman, Adelaide, and the proud father of two incredible children, Vittoria and Lorenzo — they keep life joyful, unpredictable, and deeply inspiring.
