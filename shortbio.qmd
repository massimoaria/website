# Massimo Aria

I am a **Full Professor in Statistics for Social Sciences** at the Department of Economics and Statistics of the University of Naples Federico II. I hold a **Ph.D. in Computational Statistics**.

I have been teaching Statistics and Machine Learning in bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs for over 20 years. The courses I currently teach include **Statistics for Social Sciences**, **Advanced Statistical Methods for Social Research**, **Sampling Surveys**, and the **Lab of Machine Learning in R**.

My main research fields include **bibliometrics**, **science mapping**, **systematic literature reviews**, **statistical survey methodology**, **machine learning**, and **text mining**. I have led numerous statistical surveys and data science projects related to economic, social, ethological, and healthcare phenomena.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific Activities

I have authored more than **150 peer-reviewed scientific articles**, of which **36** have been classified as “A” in scientific area 13 (Economics and Statistics) by **ANVUR** (Italian Agency of University Research Evaluation).

I am the <a href="https://www.k-synth.com" target="_blank"> **K-Synth Academic Spin-off**</a>, a science-centric information and intelligence start-up focused on the extraction and analysis of knowledge from large volumes of heterogeneous data using quantitative, statistical, and data science methods.

I am the Scientific Coordinator of the <a href="https://bibliometrix.org/sssm/" target="_blank"> **Summer School in Science Mapping (SSSM)**</a> and a faculty member of the <a href="https://esss.info/" target="_blank"> **European Summer School of Scientometrics (ESSS)**</a>.

# Social Impact of My Research Activities

**Bibliometrix** and its Shiny web app **Biblioshiny** are recognized as the most comprehensive and user-friendly software for science mapping.

In a widely cited review of bibliometric tools, Moral-Muñoz et al. (2020) wrote:

> “At this moment, maybe Bibliometrix and its Shiny platform contain the more extensive set of techniques implemented, and together with the easiness of its interface, could be a great software for practitioners.”

Today, Bibliometrix is one of the **most used** science mapping tools worldwide, with:

-   **1 million installations**
-   A **large international community** of researchers actively using and promoting it
-   **Over 150 YouTube tutorials** in multiple languages

In the past four years, I have delivered **over 60 seminars** in many Italian doctoral schools (Universities of Bergamo, Brescia, Calabria, Genoa, Polytechnic of Milan, Naples, Pisa, Rome, Salento, among others) and international ones (Universities of Bodø – Norway, Edinburgh, Granada, London, Melbourne, Paris).
